            <h1>Coding Your Ideas into Reality</h1>
        </div>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Klei. Originally from the beautiful contry of Albania,
            I now live and work in USA. I'm your go-to guy for all things web development.
            With a toolbelt packed with languages like Java, Python and JavaScript, and a knack for
            HTML and CSS, I love turning ideas into beautiful, functional websites.</p>
        <p>I'm also into the techy side of things, playing around with Kubernetes and deploying
            projects on AWS. I believe in making the web a better place, one line of code at a time.</p>
        <p>Whether you've got a tech question, need a website, want to offer a job, or just want to say hi, I'm here.
            Let's make something awesome together!</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>My passion for technology started back in Albania at the Harry Fultz Institute, where I dived
            into the world of Electronics. It was like opening a door to a world of circuits, systems and
            coding, and I was hooked!</p>

        <p>Fast forward a bit, and I found myself at the University of Maine in the USA, chasing my passion
            for coding and web development. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science,
            and with a ton of knowledge and eagerness to make a mark in the tech world.</p>

        <p>My education has been a mix of hands-on experience and academic learning. If you're curios about more details
            or how my journey has shaped my professional skills, feel free to reach out. I'm always up for a chat about tech,
            education, or potential opportunities!</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Each project is a story of challenges, learning, and, of course, fun coding.
